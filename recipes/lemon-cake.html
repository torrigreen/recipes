      <h2>steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>preheat the oven to 350&deg;f</li>
          <li>grease three 8-inch cake pans and line them with parchment paper</li>
          <li>using a mixer on medium-high, beat butter and sugar together until smooth and creamy</li>
          <li>beat in the eggs and vanilla extract until combined</li>
          <li>on low speed, mix in the the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt</li>
          <li>mix in the milk, lemon zest, and lemon juice</li>
          <li>pour the batter evenly into the cake pans and bake for 21-26 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean</li>
          <li>let the cakes cool completely in the pans on a wire rack</li>
          <li>to make the frosting, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy</li>
          <li>add the cream cheese and beat until smooth</li>
          <li>add the powdered sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract and mix on low until combined</li>
          <li>using a long serrated or really sharp knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to make them flat (crumbling this over ice cream tastes really good!)</li>
          <li>evenly cover the top of the bottom layer with 1 cup of frosting then top with the middle layer and do the same</li>
          <li>top that with the top layer and spread the rest of the frosting over the top and sides</li>
          <li>refrigerate the cake for at least 45 minutes before slicing to help it hold its shape</li>
          <li>enjoy this citrusy marvel of alchemy!</li>
        </ol>
